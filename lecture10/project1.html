            Maharana Pratap was the son of Maharana Udai Singh of the Sisodiya
             clan of Rajputs, the rulers of Mewar. Pratap became the ruler of Mewar
              against his father wish, who had appointed his favourite son Jagmal 
              as his successor. However, the senior nobles of Mewar decided that Pratap,
               the first son and rightful successor should be crowned king. Moreover, 
               Maharana Pratap was said to be a man of strong Rajput character, he was
                far more brave and chivalrous. His kind heartedness and just decision
                 making won the hearts of even his enemies. He is the only ruler of India
                  that did not give in to the Mughal rule, and for that he is the most 
                  celebrated ruler of the country to this day.
